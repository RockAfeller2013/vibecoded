To "convert" a Blender animation for use with GSAP, you typically export the animation as a 3D model file (like glTF) and use a library like Three.js to render it in the browser, then control the animation using GSAP. Alternatively, you can use the B2G script to export Blender animations to GreenSock, or even create sprite sheets from your animation and animate them with GSAP. 
Workflow 1: Blender glTF export with Three.js and GSAP
This is the most common approach for 3D animations on the web. 
Export from Blender: In Blender, export your animated 3D model in a web-friendly format like glTF (GLB). 
Import into Three.js: Use the Three.js JavaScript library to load and render your glTF model in a web browser. 
Animate with GSAP: Once your 3D model is set up in your Three.js scene, use GSAP's animation capabilities to control the 3D objects, such as rotating, moving, or scaling them. You can find examples online, such as using the three.js editor to add the final touches and control objects. 
Workflow 2: Using the B2G Script
This is a more direct (though less common) method. 
Install the B2G Script: Find and install the B2G Python script from its GitHub page.
Export Animation: The B2G script allows you to export Blender's animation data into a format that can be used with GSAP in a web project. You can then use the exported data to create a GSAP timeline.
Workflow 3: Sprite Sheets
This method is suitable for less complex animations or when working with 2D elements derived from your 3D model. 
Render to Sprite Sheet: In Blender, you can render your animation as a series of individual images or directly as a sprite sheet.
Animate with GSAP: Use GSAP's SpriteSheetUtils to control the playback and sequence of the sprite sheet images, creating a GSAP-driven animation.
