This is my personal affimations, I used ChatGPT and Deepseek, to convert to a ePub. I can use my iPhone read-aloud features as a audiobook feature to read this book. Cool huh.

This works, download the epub and rename it to .HTML, maybe it will work with .epub, but below command works
'''

- brew install pandoc
- pandoc book.html -o book.epub --metadata title="Affirmations & Principles 2026" --toc --split-level=2
