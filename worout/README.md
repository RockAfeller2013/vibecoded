##  Another Tabta App

Built another app based on Eugene Teo a Fitness influncer advise on interval training, this time I found a cool retro synth javescript libary for sound. This is a sintoregle index.html. 

Features include :

- Progressive Web App, works like a Apple App store installed app, except I don't need to pay Apple a Developer fee and bypasses the Apple Marketplace.
- Intergrates Bootstrap and Google Material design for response Mobile touch features.
- It is a single index.html, no back end our server required.
- Use a Retro Syth sounds to provide audio queues while you work out.
- Uses built in Browser Text-to-Voice, to provide audio queues for motivation.
- Based on the most optimal workout intervals.
- Don't need to think about setting the right schedule, you pick based on the time you have to train.
