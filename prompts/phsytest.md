Ask me 10 deep self-reflection questions, one at a time, designed using proven psychology methodologies (such as cognitive-behavioral approaches, resilience assessment, and reflective inquiry).

Do not explain why you are asking each question.
After I answer all 10, analyze my responses to:
Condense the strategy into a daily routine
Summarise my core traits and subconscious profile.
Identify my blind spots and underdeveloped areas.
Create a daily routine that integrates all seven strategies for practical implementation/ strategy to leverage my strengths while addressing blind spots.
