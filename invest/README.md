# Disclosure of Financial Interests for Australian Politicians

In Australia, politicians are required to disclose their financial interests to maintain transparency and public trust. Both Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Representatives and Senators in the Senate must follow strict timelines and processes for these disclosures.

## House of Representatives

- MPs must submit a statement of their financial interests, including investments, property, liabilities, gifts, and other relevant holdings, within 28 days of taking their seat.  
- Any changes to these interests must also be disclosed within 28 days of the change.  
- These disclosures are compiled into the **Register of Members’ Interests**, which is publicly accessible on the Parliament of Australia website.

## Senate

- Senators must lodge their initial disclosure within 28 days of being sworn in, or within 28 days of the first sitting after a general election.  
- Changes to interests must be declared within 35 days.  
- The **Register of Senators’ Interests** is maintained by the Committee of Senators’ Interests and is tabled in Parliament regularly, with updates published for public access.

## Public Access

Both registers are published online through the official Parliament of Australia website. They are updated as new disclosures and alterations are made, allowing citizens, journalists, and watchdog groups to track the financial interests of elected officials.

## Why It Matters

These rules are designed to reduce conflicts of interest and ensure accountability. By requiring timely and detailed disclosure, the system aims to safeguard the integrity of Australia’s democratic institutions.
